	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) has become a popular method to estimate elastic earth properties from seismograms. It is formulated as a data-fitting least-squares minimization problem that iteratively updates an initial velocity model with the scaled gradient of the misfit until a satisfactory match between the real and synthetic data is obtained. However, such a local optimization approach can converge to a local minimum if the starting model used is not close enough to an optimal model.We have developed a two-step process in which we first estimate a starting model using a global optimization method. Unlike local optimization methods, a global optimization method starts with a random starting model and is not generally susceptible to be trapped in a local minimum. The starting model for FWI that we aim to estimate is sparsely parameterized and contains a set of interfaces and velocities that are used to represent the entire velocity model. We have obtained the depth of the interfaces and the velocities by minimizing the data misfit in the least-squares sense using a global optimization method called very fast simulated annealing (VFSA). Once the sparse velocity model was obtained from VFSA, we used that as a starting model in a conventional gradient- based FWI to obtain the final model. We have applied the proposed method to one synthetic data set and two field data sets from offshore India. The proposed method was able to estimate a velocity model that was not cycle skipped for realistic frequency bands. We have demonstrated that with the proper choice of model parameterization and optimization parameters, the global and gradient optimization algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations. We have determined that the resulting algorithm is computationally feasible in two dimensions and accurate for practical implementation of FWI.},

	abstract = {A source inversion method using very fast simulated annealing is proposed to estimate the earthquake rupture process, and associated radiation of broadband strong ground motions. We invert the displacement and velocity motions separately to estimate the spatio-temporal distributions of effective stress and moment. The developed method is applied to the near-source strong motions in the frequency range up to 5 Hz from the 1997 Izu-Hanto Toho-Oki earthquake (MJMA 5.9). Results of the displacement inversion indicate that for this earthquake the seismic moment is mainly released from the shallower region and the northern area from the hypocenter. Similar results are obtained from the velocity inversion, and the variation of the effective stress also exhibits a similar behavior to the moment distribution. Based on the inversion results, we propose a characterized source model that consists of the finite number of asperities and a background area with uniform effective stresses. The broadband ground motion simulation demonstrates that the characterized source model successfully reproduces the observed ground motions in spite of the simplification of actual (inverted) source process. This suggests our proposed inversion method and source characterization process are suitable for the strong-motion prediction that reflects the high-frequency radiation from an actual earthquake. {\textcopyright} 2005, The Seismological Society of Japan, Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, The Volcanological Society of Japan, The Geodetic Society of Japan, The Japanese Society for Planetary Sciences.

@article{Datta2019,
	abstract = {A good starting model is imperative in full-waveform inversion (FWI) because it solves a least-squares inversion problem using a local gradient-based optimization method. A suboptimal starting model can result in cycle skipping leading to poor convergence and incorrect estimation of subsurface properties. This problem is especially crucial for salt models because the strong velocity contrasts create substantial time shifts in the modeled seismogram. Incorrect estimation of salt bodies leads to velocity inaccuracies in the sediments because the least-squares gradient aims to reduce traveltime differences without considering the sharp velocity jump between sediments and salt. We have developed a technique to estimate velocity models containing salt bodies using a combination of global and local optimization techniques. To stabilize the global optimization algorithm and keep it computationally tractable, we reduce the number of model parameters by using sparse parameterization formulations. The sparse formulation represents sediments using a set of interfaces and velocities across them, whereas a set of ellipses represents the salt body. We use very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) to minimize the misfit between the observed and synthetic data and estimate an optimal model in the sparsely parameterized space. The VFSA inverted model is then used as a starting model in FWI in which the sediments and salt body are updated in the least-squares sense. We partition model updates into sediment and salt updates in which the sediments are updated like conventional FWI, whereas the shape of the salt is updated by taking the zero crossing of an evolving level set surface. Our algorithm is tested on two 2D synthetic salt models, namely, the Sigsbee 2A model and a modified SEG Advanced Modeling Program (SEAM) Phase I model while fixing the top of the salt. We determine the efficiency of the VFSA inversion and imaging improvements from the level set FWI approach and evaluate a few sources of uncertainty in the estimation of salt shapes.},

@article{Mazzotti2016,
	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) tries to estimate velocity models of the subsurface with improved accuracy and resolution compared to conventional methods. To be successful, it needs input data that is rich in low frequencies and possibly characterized by long source-to-receiver offsets. The correct solution of the inverse problem by means of local methods is facilitated if the starting model lies in the "valley" of the cost-function global minimum. We explore the possibility of relaxing this requirement by using genetic algorithms, a stochastic optimization method, as the driver of the FWI (GA FWI). However, stochastic methods are affected by the "curse of dimensionality," meaning that they require huge and sometimes even unaffordable computer resources for inverse problems with many unknowns and costly forward modeling. Therefore, we need to adopt proper stratagems in the inversion and limit our goal to the estimation of a velocity macromodel that is of a model with only the long-wavelength velocity structures, which could eventually act as the starting model for a local, higher-resolution gradient-based inversion. To this end, in the GA FWI we parametrize the subsurface with two grids: (1) a coarse grid with widely spaced nodes, that is unknowns, for the inversion, and (2) a fine grid with shorter spacing for the modeling. As a side result, we can also have an estimate of the uncertainty at the solution nodes of the grid. The approach we discuss is 2D acoustic in the time domain, with finite difference forward modeling. The examples we show refer to the Marmousi model and to a marine field data set.},

The inversion scheme is based on a finite-difference solution of the 2-D elastic wave equation in the time-distance domain. The strength of this approach is the ability to generate all possible wave types (body waves and surface waves, etc.) and thus to simulate complex seismic wavefields that are then compared with observed data to infer subsurface properties. The capability of this inversion technique is tested with both synthetic and real experimental data sets. The inversion results from synthetic data show the ability of characterizing both low- and high-velocity layers, and the inversion results from real data are generally consistent with crosshole, SPT N-value, and material log results, including the identification of a buried low-velocity layer. Based upon the cases presented, coupling of global optimization with full waveforms is computationally practical, as the results presented herein were all achieved in about two hours of computer time on a standard laptop computer.},

	abstract = {Conventional surface wave inversion for shallow shear (S)-wave velocity relies on the generation of dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves. This constrains the method to only laterally homogeneous (or very smooth laterally heterogeneous) earth models. Waveform inversion directly fits waveforms on seismograms, hence, does not have such a limitation. Waveforms of Rayleigh waves are highly related to S-wave velocities. By inverting the waveforms of Rayleigh waves on a near-surface seismogram, shallow S-wave velocities can be estimated for earth models with strong lateral heterogeneity. We employ genetic algorithm (GA) to perform waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves for S-wave velocities. The forward problem is solved by finite-difference modeling in the time domain. The model space is updated by generating offspring models using GA. Final solutions can be found through an iterative waveform-fitting scheme. Inversions based on synthetic records show that the S-wave velocities can be recovered successfully with errors no more than 10% for several typical near-surface earth models. For layered earth models, the proposed method can generate one-dimensional S-wave velocity profiles without the knowledge of initial models. For earth models containing lateral heterogeneity in which case conventional dispersion-curve-based inversion methods are challenging, it is feasible to produce high-resolution S-wave velocity sections by GA waveform inversion with appropriate priori information. The synthetic tests indicate that the GA waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves has the great potential for shallow S-wave velocity imaging with the existence of strong lateral heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Stochastic optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function within a given parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients of the misfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of models and associated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior probability distribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and their associated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior probability distribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability distributions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a hybrid method that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an analytical function and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the true probability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true uncertainties. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibbs sampler step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributions. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversions on synthetic and field data. We also discuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential to attenuate the “genetic drift” effect and to maximize the exploration of the model space. In fact, a wide and efficient exploration of the model space is important not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algorithm optimization but also to ensure a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions in the subsequent Gibbs sampler step.},

A simple search strategy in PSO guides the algorithm toward the best solution through constant updating of the cognitive knowledge and social behavior of the particles in the swarm. To evaluate the applicability of PSO to inversion of geophysical data, we inverted three noise-corrupted synthetic sounding data sets over a multilayered 1D earth model by using DC, induced polarization (IP), and magnetotelluric (MT) methods. The results show that acceptable solutions can be obtained with a swarm of about 300 particles and that convergence occurs in less than 100 iterations. The time required to execute a PSO algorithm is comparable to that of a genetic algorithm (GA). Similarly, the models estimated from PSO and GA are close to the true solutions. Whereas a ridge regression (RR) algorithm converges in four to eight iterations, it yields satisfactory results only when the initial model is very close to the true model. Models estimated from PSO explain observed, vertical electric sounding (VES) and MT data, from Bhiwani district, Haryana, India, and the Chottanagpur gneissic complex, Dhanbad, India.

Geophysical inversion can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the best parameters whose forward synthesis data most fit the observed data. The inverse problems are usually highly non-linear, multi-modal as well as ill-posed, so conventional optimization algorithms cannot handle it very efficiently. In the past decades, genetic algorithm (GA) and its many variants are widely applied to inverse problems and achieve great success. Swarm intelligence algorithms are a family of global optimizers inspired by swarm phenomena in nature, and have shown better performance than GA for diverse optimization problems. However, swarm intelligence algorithms are not utilized for geophysical inversion problems until recently and only limited number of works are reported. In this paper, we try to apply two swarm intelligence algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), to the regional seismic waveform inversion. To explore the advantages and disadvantages of swarm intelligence algorithms over GA, synthetic experiments are conducted by using these two swarm intelligence algorithm and several GA variants as well as Differential Evolution (DE). The experimental results show that, both swarm intelligence algorithms outperform the widely used GA, DE, and the models estimated by swarm intelligence algorithms are closer to the true solution. The promising results imply that swarm intelligence algorithms are a potentially more powerful tool for inversion problems.},
