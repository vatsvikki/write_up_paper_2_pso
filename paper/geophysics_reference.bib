@article{Datta2016,
	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) has become a popular method to estimate elastic earth properties from seismograms. It is formulated as a data-fitting least-squares minimization problem that iteratively updates an initial velocity model with the scaled gradient of the misfit until a satisfactory match between the real and synthetic data is obtained. However, such a local optimization approach can converge to a local minimum if the starting model used is not close enough to an optimal model.We have developed a two-step process in which we first estimate a starting model using a global optimization method. Unlike local optimization methods, a global optimization method starts with a random starting model and is not generally susceptible to be trapped in a local minimum. The starting model for FWI that we aim to estimate is sparsely parameterized and contains a set of interfaces and velocities that are used to represent the entire velocity model. We have obtained the depth of the interfaces and the velocities by minimizing the data misfit in the least-squares sense using a global optimization method called very fast simulated annealing (VFSA). Once the sparse velocity model was obtained from VFSA, we used that as a starting model in a conventional gradient- based FWI to obtain the final model. We have applied the proposed method to one synthetic data set and two field data sets from offshore India. The proposed method was able to estimate a velocity model that was not cycle skipped for realistic frequency bands. We have demonstrated that with the proper choice of model parameterization and optimization parameters, the global and gradient optimization algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations. We have determined that the resulting algorithm is computationally feasible in two dimensions and accurate for practical implementation of FWI.},
