	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) has become a popular method to estimate elastic earth properties from seismograms. It is formulated as a data-fitting least-squares minimization problem that iteratively updates an initial velocity model with the scaled gradient of the misfit until a satisfactory match between the real and synthetic data is obtained. However, such a local optimization approach can converge to a local minimum if the starting model used is not close enough to an optimal model.We have developed a two-step process in which we first estimate a starting model using a global optimization method. Unlike local optimization methods, a global optimization method starts with a random starting model and is not generally susceptible to be trapped in a local minimum. The starting model for FWI that we aim to estimate is sparsely parameterized and contains a set of interfaces and velocities that are used to represent the entire velocity model. We have obtained the depth of the interfaces and the velocities by minimizing the data misfit in the least-squares sense using a global optimization method called very fast simulated annealing (VFSA). Once the sparse velocity model was obtained from VFSA, we used that as a starting model in a conventional gradient- based FWI to obtain the final model. We have applied the proposed method to one synthetic data set and two field data sets from offshore India. The proposed method was able to estimate a velocity model that was not cycle skipped for realistic frequency bands. We have demonstrated that with the proper choice of model parameterization and optimization parameters, the global and gradient optimization algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations. We have determined that the resulting algorithm is computationally feasible in two dimensions and accurate for practical implementation of FWI.},

	abstract = {A source inversion method using very fast simulated annealing is proposed to estimate the earthquake rupture process, and associated radiation of broadband strong ground motions. We invert the displacement and velocity motions separately to estimate the spatio-temporal distributions of effective stress and moment. The developed method is applied to the near-source strong motions in the frequency range up to 5 Hz from the 1997 Izu-Hanto Toho-Oki earthquake (MJMA 5.9). Results of the displacement inversion indicate that for this earthquake the seismic moment is mainly released from the shallower region and the northern area from the hypocenter. Similar results are obtained from the velocity inversion, and the variation of the effective stress also exhibits a similar behavior to the moment distribution. Based on the inversion results, we propose a characterized source model that consists of the finite number of asperities and a background area with uniform effective stresses. The broadband ground motion simulation demonstrates that the characterized source model successfully reproduces the observed ground motions in spite of the simplification of actual (inverted) source process. This suggests our proposed inversion method and source characterization process are suitable for the strong-motion prediction that reflects the high-frequency radiation from an actual earthquake. {\textcopyright} 2005, The Seismological Society of Japan, Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, The Volcanological Society of Japan, The Geodetic Society of Japan, The Japanese Society for Planetary Sciences.

@article{Datta2019,
	abstract = {A good starting model is imperative in full-waveform inversion (FWI) because it solves a least-squares inversion problem using a local gradient-based optimization method. A suboptimal starting model can result in cycle skipping leading to poor convergence and incorrect estimation of subsurface properties. This problem is especially crucial for salt models because the strong velocity contrasts create substantial time shifts in the modeled seismogram. Incorrect estimation of salt bodies leads to velocity inaccuracies in the sediments because the least-squares gradient aims to reduce traveltime differences without considering the sharp velocity jump between sediments and salt. We have developed a technique to estimate velocity models containing salt bodies using a combination of global and local optimization techniques. To stabilize the global optimization algorithm and keep it computationally tractable, we reduce the number of model parameters by using sparse parameterization formulations. The sparse formulation represents sediments using a set of interfaces and velocities across them, whereas a set of ellipses represents the salt body. We use very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) to minimize the misfit between the observed and synthetic data and estimate an optimal model in the sparsely parameterized space. The VFSA inverted model is then used as a starting model in FWI in which the sediments and salt body are updated in the least-squares sense. We partition model updates into sediment and salt updates in which the sediments are updated like conventional FWI, whereas the shape of the salt is updated by taking the zero crossing of an evolving level set surface. Our algorithm is tested on two 2D synthetic salt models, namely, the Sigsbee 2A model and a modified SEG Advanced Modeling Program (SEAM) Phase I model while fixing the top of the salt. We determine the efficiency of the VFSA inversion and imaging improvements from the level set FWI approach and evaluate a few sources of uncertainty in the estimation of salt shapes.},

@article{Mazzotti2016,
	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) tries to estimate velocity models of the subsurface with improved accuracy and resolution compared to conventional methods. To be successful, it needs input data that is rich in low frequencies and possibly characterized by long source-to-receiver offsets. The correct solution of the inverse problem by means of local methods is facilitated if the starting model lies in the "valley" of the cost-function global minimum. We explore the possibility of relaxing this requirement by using genetic algorithms, a stochastic optimization method, as the driver of the FWI (GA FWI). However, stochastic methods are affected by the "curse of dimensionality," meaning that they require huge and sometimes even unaffordable computer resources for inverse problems with many unknowns and costly forward modeling. Therefore, we need to adopt proper stratagems in the inversion and limit our goal to the estimation of a velocity macromodel that is of a model with only the long-wavelength velocity structures, which could eventually act as the starting model for a local, higher-resolution gradient-based inversion. To this end, in the GA FWI we parametrize the subsurface with two grids: (1) a coarse grid with widely spaced nodes, that is unknowns, for the inversion, and (2) a fine grid with shorter spacing for the modeling. As a side result, we can also have an estimate of the uncertainty at the solution nodes of the grid. The approach we discuss is 2D acoustic in the time domain, with finite difference forward modeling. The examples we show refer to the Marmousi model and to a marine field data set.},

The capability of this inversion technique is tested with both synthetic and real experimental data sets. The inversion results from synthetic data show the ability of characterizing both low- and high-velocity layers, and the inversion results from real data are generally consistent with crosshole, SPT N-value, and material log results, including the identification of a buried low-velocity layer.

	abstract = {Conventional surface wave inversion for shallow shear (S)-wave velocity relies on the generation of dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves. This constrains the method to only laterally homogeneous (or very smooth laterally heterogeneous) earth models. Waveform inversion directly fits waveforms on seismograms, hence, does not have such a limitation. Waveforms of Rayleigh waves are highly related to S-wave velocities. By inverting the waveforms of Rayleigh waves on a near-surface seismogram, shallow S-wave velocities can be estimated for earth models with strong lateral heterogeneity. We employ genetic algorithm (GA) to perform waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves for S-wave velocities. The forward problem is solved by finite-difference modeling in the time domain. The model space is updated by generating offspring models using GA. Final solutions can be found through an iterative waveform-fitting scheme. Inversions based on synthetic records show that the S-wave velocities can be recovered successfully with errors no more than 10% for several typical near-surface earth models. For layered earth models, the proposed method can generate one-dimensional S-wave velocity profiles without the knowledge of initial models. For earth models containing lateral heterogeneity in which case conventional dispersion-curve-based inversion methods are challenging, it is feasible to produce high-resolution S-wave velocity sections by GA waveform inversion with appropriate priori information. The synthetic tests indicate that the GA waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves has the great potential for shallow S-wave velocity imaging with the existence of strong lateral heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Stochastic optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function within a given parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients of the misfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of models and associated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior probability distribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and their associated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior probability distribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability distributions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a hybrid method that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an analytical function and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the true probability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true uncertainties. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibbs sampler step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributions. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversions on synthetic and field data. We also discuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential to attenuate the “genetic drift” effect and to maximize the exploration of the model space. In fact, a wide and efficient exploration of the model space is important not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algorithm optimization but also to ensure a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions in the subsequent Gibbs sampler step.},

A simple search strategy in PSO guides the algorithm toward the best solution through constant updating of the cognitive knowledge and social behavior of the particles in the swarm. To evaluate the applicability of PSO to inversion of geophysical data, we inverted three noise-corrupted synthetic sounding data sets over a multilayered 1D earth model by using DC, induced polarization (IP), and magnetotelluric (MT) methods. The results show that acceptable solutions can be obtained with a swarm of about 300 particles and that convergence occurs in less than 100 iterations. The time required to execute a PSO algorithm is comparable to that of a genetic algorithm (GA). Similarly, the models estimated from PSO and GA are close to the true solutions. Whereas a ridge regression (RR) algorithm converges in four to eight iterations, it yields satisfactory results only when the initial model is very close to the true model.

Geophysical inversion can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the best parameters whose forward synthesis data most fit the observed data.

In the past decades, genetic algorithm (GA) and its many variants are widely applied to inverse problems and achieve great success. Swarm intelligence algorithms are a family of global optimizers inspired by swarm phenomena in nature, and have shown better performance than GA for diverse optimization problems. However, swarm intelligence algorithms are not utilized for geophysical inversion problems until recently and only limited number of works are reported. In this paper, we try to apply two swarm intelligence algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), to the regional seismic waveform inversion. To explore the advantages and disadvantages of swarm intelligence algorithms over GA, synthetic experiments are conducted by using these two swarm intelligence algorithm and several GA variants as well as Differential Evolution (DE). The experimental results show that, both swarm intelligence algorithms outperform the widely used GA, DE, and the models estimated by swarm intelligence algorithms are closer to the true solution.

However, for obtaining more specific information about the buried object, some more advanced algorithms are required. In this study, the PSO, which has been used to solve many engineering problems, is utilized to invert the GPR traces for detecting various types of buried plastic pipe fillings. Firstly, we confirmed the applicability of PSO to GPR traces using numerical modeling. Then, the data acquired over buried pipe filling materials (air, water ice) were evaluated experimentally by the proposed method. Determination of the filling material is one of the most popular problems of shallow pipe exploration by GPR. The inversion process resulted in good data fit between observed and calculated traces for air-filled, water-filled, and ice-filled pipe. The estimated dielectric properties including relative dielectric permittivity, conductivity, and relative magnetic permeability values were in the range of the corresponding parameter values in the literature at the end of inversion for each model. These results show that the PSO method applied to GPR data can distinguish plastic pipe contents. Moreover, the results suggest that PSO can be used for the quantitative interpretation of GPR data.},

@article{Sambridge1992,
	abstract = {Recently a new class of methods, to solve non‐linear optimization problems, has generated considerable interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. These methods, known as genetic algorithms, are able to solve highly non‐linear and non‐local optimization problems and belong to the class of global optimization techniques, which includes Monte Carlo and Simulated Annealing methods. Unlike local techniques, such as damped least squares or conjugate gradients, genetic algorithms avoid all use of curvature information on the objective function. This means that they do not require any derivative information and therefore one can use any type of misfit function equally well. Most iterative methods work with a single model and find improvements by perturbing it in some fashion. Genetic algorithms, however, work with a group of models simultaneously and use stochastic processes to guide the search for an optimal solution. Both Simulated Annealing and genetic algorithms are modelled on natural optimization systems. Simulated Annealing uses an analogy with thermodynamics; genetic algorithms have an analogy with biological evolution. This evolution leads to an efficient exchange of information between all models encountered, and allows the algorithm to rapidly assimilate and exploit the information gained to find better data fitting models. To illustrate the power of genetic algorithms compared to Monte Carlo, we consider a simple multidimensional quadratic optimization problem and show that its relative efficiency increases dramatically as the number of unknowns is increased. As an example of their use in a geophysical problem with real data we consider the non‐linear inversion of marine seismic refraction waveforms. The results show that genetic algorithms are inherently superior to random search techniques and can also perform better than iterative matrix inversion which requires a good starting model. This is primarily because genetic algorithms are able to combine both local and global search mechanisms into a single efficient method. Since many forward and inverse problems involve solving an optimization problem, we expect that the genetic approach will find applications in many other geophysical problems; these include seismic ray tracing, earthquake location, non‐linear data fitting and, possibly seismic tomography.

	abstract = {Inversion is a critical and challenging task in geophysical research. Geophysical inversion can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the best parameters whose forward synthesis data most fit the observed data. The inverse problems are usually highly non-linear, multi-modal as well as ill-posed, so conventional optimization algorithms cannot handle it very efficiently. In the past decades, genetic algorithm (GA) and its many variants are widely applied to inverse problems and achieve great success. Swarm intelligence algorithms are a family of global optimizers inspired by swarm phenomena in nature, and have shown better performance than GA for diverse optimization problems. However, swarm intelligence algorithms are not utilized for geophysical inversion problems until recently and only limited number of works are reported. In this paper, we try to apply two swarm intelligence algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), to the regional seismic waveform inversion. To explore the advantages and disadvantages of swarm intelligence algorithms over GA, synthetic experiments are conducted by using these two swarm intelligence algorithm and several GA variants as well as Differential Evolution (DE). The experimental results show that, both swarm intelligence algorithms outperform the widely used GA, DE, and the models estimated by swarm intelligence algorithms are closer to the true solution. The promising results imply that swarm intelligence algorithms are a potentially more powerful tool for inversion problems.},

@article{Aleardi2017,
	abstract = {Stochastic optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function within a given parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients of the misfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of models and associated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior probability distribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and their associated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior probability distribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability distributions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a hybrid method that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an analytical function and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the true probability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true uncertainties. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibbs sampler step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributions. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversions on synthetic and field data. We also discuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential to attenuate the “genetic drift” effect and to maximize the exploration of the model space. In fact, a wide and efficient exploration of the model space is important not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algorithm optimization but also to ensure a reliable estimation of the posterior probability distributions in the subsequent Gibbs sampler step.},

@article{Tarantola1986,
	abstract = {Three parameters are needed to describe a perfectly elastic, isotropic Earth. These may be the density $\rho$(x) and the Lame's parameters $\gamma$(x) and $\mu$(x), or the density $\rho$(x) and the P-wave and S-wave velocities $\alpha$(x) and $\beta$(x). The choice of parameters is not neutral in the sense that although theoretically equivalent, if they are not adequately chosen the numerical algorithms used in the inversion can be very inefficient. In the long spatial wavelengths of the model, adequate parameters are the P-wave and S-wave velocities, while in the short spatial wavelengths, P-wave impedance, 5-wave impedance, and density are adequate. The problem of inversion of waveforms is highly nonlinear for the long spatial wavelengths of the velocities, while it is reasonably linear for the short spatial wavelengths of the impedances and density. Furthermore, this parameterization defines a highly hierarchical problem: the long spatial wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and short spatial wavelengths of the P-wave impedance are much more important parameters than their counterparts for S-waves (in terms of interpreting observed amplitudes), and the latter are much more important than the density. This suggests solution of the general inverse problem (which must involve all the parameters) optimizing first for the P-wave velocity and impedance, then for the 5-wave velocity and impedance, and finally for density. As a by-product of the method proposed here, a generalization to the elastic case of the equations of multioffset acoustic migration is obtained.},

	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging data-fitting procedure based on full-wavefield modeling to extract quantitative information from seismograms. High-resolution imaging at half the propagated wavelength is expected. Recent advances in high-performance computing and multifold/multicomponent wide-aperture and wide-azimuth acquisitions make 3D acoustic FWI feasible today. Key ingredients of FWI are an efficient forward-modeling engine and a local differential approach, in which the gradient and the Hessian operators are efficiently estimated. Local optimization does not, however, prevent convergence of the misfit function toward local minima because of the limited accuracy of the starting model, the lack of low frequencies, the presence of noise, and the approximate modeling of thewave-physics complexity. Different hierarchical multiscale strategies are designed to mitigate the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of FWI by incorporating progressively shorter wavelengths in the parameter space. Synthetic and real-data case studies address reconstructing various parameters, from P and S velocities to density, anisotropy, and attenuation. This review attempts to illuminate the state of the art of FWI. Crucial jumps, however, remain necessary to make it as popular as migration techniques. The challenges can be categorized as (1) building accurate starting models with automatic procedures and/or recording low frequencies, (2) defining new minimization criteria to mitigate the sensitivity of FWI to amplitude errors and increasing the robustness of FWI when multiple parameter classes are estimated, and (3) improving computational efficiency by data-compression techniques to make 3D elastic FWI feasible. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

@article{Liu2017,
	abstract = {In fullwaveforminversion (FWI) with the least-squares (L2) norm, the direct amplitude matching is never perfect and the accurate estimation of the seismic source strength is not always available. In contrast, the normalized zero-lag cross-correlation objective function relaxes on the amplitude constraints and emphasizes the phase information when measuring the closeness between the simulated and observed data. This FWI method becomes insensitive to differences in amplitude. Based on this property, we investigate the effectiveness and robustness of FWI with the normalized zero-lag cross-correlation function (CFWI) against the noise and unpredictable amplitude of the data that cannot be modelled by the wavefield extrapolation operator. The effectiveness is firstly tested by noise-free data and data contaminated by Gaussian white noise. In addition, CFWI can invert the data set with incorrect source strength when compared with the L2 norm. Moreover, the data set with incorrect source signature illustrates that CFWI is slightly more insensitive to the error in source signature than the L2 norm. However, a source inversion is still needed when the source signature is severely erroneous. With non-Gaussian noise data, such as contaminated by strong ground motion noise and even by spike-type noise, CFWI provides a comparable result with that of the robust Huber norm. Numerical experiments with non-Gaussian noise also indicate that CFWI can suppress noise in data to produce clearer images when compared with the Huber norm. Besides, CFWI is free of the threshold criterion that controls the transition between the L2 and L1 norms used with the Huber and Hybrid norms and therefore free from tedious trial-and-error tests. Several numerical examples support that CFWI is an alternative and reliable inversion method. However, a numerical test with a 1-D initial model confirms that CFWI is more sensitive to the cycle-skipping problem caused by less-accurate initial velocity model than the L2 norm, which is due to the wrong matched events contributing to spurious local minima of the objective function of CFWI, but to an increase in the objective function used with the L2 norm.},

@article{Metivier2018,
	abstract = {Optimal transport distance has been recently promoted as a tool to measure the discrepancy between observed and seismic data within the full-waveform-inversion strategy. This high-resolution seismic imaging method, based on a data-fitting procedure, suffers from the nonconvexity of the standard least-squares discrepancy measure, an issue commonly referred to as cycle skipping. The convexity of the optimal transport distance with respect to time shifts makes it a good candidate to provide a more convex misfit function. However, the optimal transport distance is defined only for the comparison of positive functions, while seismic data are oscillatory. A review of the different attempts proposed in the literature to overcome this difficulty is proposed. Their limitations are illustrated: Basically, the proposed strategies are either not applicable to real data, or they lose the convexity property of optimal transport. On this basis, we introduce a novel strategy based on the interpretation of the seismic data in the graph space. Each individual trace is considered, after discretization, as a set of Dirac points in a 2D space, where the amplitude becomes a geometric attribute of the data. This ensures the positivity of the data, while preserving the geometry of the signal. The differentiability of the misfit function is obtained by approximating the Dirac distributions through 2D Gaussian functions. The interest of this approach is illustrated numerically by computing misfit-function maps in schematic examples before moving to more realistic synthetic full-waveform exercises, including the Marmousi model. The better convexity of the graph-based optimal transport distance is shown. On the Marmousi model, starting from a 1D linearly increasing initial model, with data without low frequencies (no energy less than 3Hz), a meaningful estimation of the P-wave velocity model is recovered, outperforming previously proposed optimal-transport-based misfit functions.},

@article{Plessix2006,
	abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved. Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},
