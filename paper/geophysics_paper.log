 objective function prepared for the minimization is a multimodal function havi

e the tendency to move towards the nearest extrema this make it imposible to co

 make it neccesary to start the inversion with a inital model located near to t

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 This problem of stucking with the local minima is associated
 with the starting model. This problem can be dealt with preapring the initial 
model with the global optimization method becuase it have the ability to explor
e all the search space to find a optimal solution without the intervention of h
uman being as required in ray based tomography metyhods for preapring the intia
l model by this it also reduce the chance of inclusion of human errors. this su
permacy of global optimization motivated its utilization in prepasring the star
ting model for calculas based seismic inversion methods. The global optimizatio
n are inspired with the natural phenomina. the idea of preparing the initial mo
del with the global optimization is because of the slow exploitation of these m
ethods. once the initial model is prepared with the confidence that it lie in t
he basin of global minima then local optimization statred with this model becau
se local minima methods have high exploitation rate.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 In geophysics, very fast simulated annealing (VFSA), genetic
 algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are most commonly used m
ethods for seismic inversion. \cite{Datta2016} used the VFSA for preapring the 
initial model in this two step process, parameterization of model is accomplish
ed by the zero offset section, \cite{Fu2021} proposed a paralled VFSA algorithm
  for 1.5D acoustic FWI where model parameters are simultaneously updated acros
s multiple threads, \cite{Shiba2005} implemented the VFSA algorithm to estimate
 earthquake displacement and demonstrated that VFSA outperforms the GA in this 
task, \cite{Mendes2024} used a training image to guide the generation of realis
tic velocity model samples and enhance the convergence, \cite{Datta2019} implim
ent the VFSA where the sedimentary layers and salt bodies are represented by se
t of interfaces and ellipses respectively, \cite{Mazzotti2016} proposed GA FWI 
method involves parametrizing the subsurface with two grids: a coarse grid for 
inversion and a fine grid for modeling, \cite{ktran2012} demonstrates the poten
tial of GA  for improved characterization subsurface properties, \cite{Zeng2011
} studied GA for Rayleigh wave inversion, \cite{Aleardi2017} proposed the seism
ic inversion with the GA with markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) method to deal wi
th the uncertainties in the search space, \cite{Yang2017} developed a PSO based
 method for impedance inversion, \cite{Shaw2007} demonstrates the effectiveness
 of PSO in inverting geophysical data for natural resource exploration, \cite{D
ing2015} focusing on the application of PSO to solve geophysical inverse proble
ms, specifically a 1D-DC resistivity case, \cite{Kaplanvural2020} The research 
contributes to the literature by demonstrating the ability of PSO to invert com
mon-offset ground penetrating (GPR) traces and estimate dielectric properties, 
including conductivity and relative magnetic permeability, \cite{Fernandez-Mart

 optimization method. A comparison of the performance of GAs to Monte Carlo is 
studied which find that GAs can achieve better fits with fewer model parameters
 and are computationally efficient \citep{Sambridge1992}. A comparison between 
the GA, and PSO is also performed, conclude that PSO outperform the GA \citep{D

 stochastic optimization methods|adaptive simulated annealing (ASA), GA, neighb

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic method dev
eloped by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart in 1995. Inspired by the social be
havior of birds flocking to find food, they formulated a mathematical model to 
simulate this behavior. This model is widely applied to solve various optimizat
ion problems. They identified that the fundamental principle guiding birds' foo
d-finding behavior is their ability to communicate with each other. Each bird i
n the process knows its current position \((\mathbf{x}_i(t))\) and best positio
n \((\mathbf{p}_i(t))\), determined by evaluating the fitness using a cost func
tion. Additionally, each bird shares its best position with others, contributin
g to the collective knowledge of the flock's best position \((\mathbf{g}(t))\).
 Each bird's next movement is adjusted by its own best, the flock's best, and i
ts current position. This iterative process continues at each step, ultimately 
converging towards a globally optimal position through the collaborative effort
 of all birds.This natural phenomenon is mathematically described by the veloci
ty update equation \ref{eqn:pso_1} and the position update equation \ref{eqn:ps
o_2}.[]

ht \((w)\), acceleration coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2)\), population size of
 the swarm, and the number of iterations. Among these, the inertia weight is th
e most critical tuning parameter as it balances the exploration and exploitatio
n capabilities of PSO by adjusting the contribution of the particle's previous 
velocity. An inertia weight value between 0.4 and 0.9 is generally found to pro
vide good convergence. The cognitive and social coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2
)\) represent the confidence in a particle's own best position and the swarm's 
best position, respectively, and they influence the updated velocity of the par
ticles. The number of particles in the swarm also affects convergence; as the n
umber of particles increases, the search space expands, potentially leading to 
better convergence. Experimental studies have shown that a swarm size of around
 30 particles is generally effective for finding solutions within optimal itera
tions. The number of iterations, as with all iterative optimization algorithms,
 significantly impacts the performance of PSO.[]

ic algorithms, a stochastic optimization method, as the driver of the FWI (GA F
WI). However, stochastic methods are affected by the "curse of dimensionality,"
 meaning that they require huge and sometimes even unaffordable computer resour
ces for inverse problems with many unknowns and costly forward modeling. Theref
ore, we need to adopt proper stratagems in the inversion and limit our goal to 
the estimation of a velocity macromodel that is of a model with only the long-w
avelength velocity structures, which could eventually act as the starting model
 for a local, higher-resolution gradient-based inversion. To this end, in the G
A FWI we parametrize the subsurface with two grids: (1) a coarse grid with wide
ly spaced nodes, that is unknowns, for the inversion, and (2) a fine grid with 
shorter spacing for the modeling. As a side result, we can also have an estimat
e of the uncertainty at the solution nodes of the grid. The approach we discuss
 is 2D acoustic in the time domain, with finite difference forward modeling. Th
e examples we show refer to the Marmousi model and to a marine field data set.}

shear (S)-wave velocity relies on the generation of dispersion curves of Raylei
gh waves. This constrains the method to only laterally homogeneous (or very smo
oth laterally heterogeneous) earth models. Waveform inversion directly fits wav
eforms on seismograms, hence, does not have such a limitation. Waveforms of Ray
leigh waves are highly related to S-wave velocities. By inverting the waveforms
 of Rayleigh waves on a near-surface seismogram, shallow S-wave velocities can 
be estimated for earth models with strong lateral heterogeneity. We employ gene
tic algorithm (GA) to perform waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves for S-wave v
elocities. The forward problem is solved by finite-difference modeling in the t
ime domain. The model space is updated by generating offspring models using GA.
 Final solutions can be found through an iterative waveform-fitting scheme. Inv
ersions based on synthetic records show that the S-wave velocities can be recov
ered successfully with errors no more than 10% for several typical near-surface
 earth models. For layered earth models, the proposed method can generate one-d
imensional S-wave velocity profiles without the knowledge of initial models. Fo
r earth models containing lateral heterogeneity in which case conventional disp
ersion-curve-based inversion methods are challenging, it is feasible to produce
 high-resolution S-wave velocity sections by GA waveform inversion with appropr

s genetic algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function with
in a given parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients 
of the misfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of mod
els and associated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior proba
bility distribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain
 Monte Carlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and
 their associated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior prob
ability distribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as th
e Metropolis{Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability
 distributions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a 
hybrid method that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal
 solution and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation o
f the posterior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an ana
lytical function and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the 
true probability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true unce
rtainties. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibb
s sampler step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributio
ns. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing 
one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversions on synthetic and field data. W
e also discuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential
 to attenuate the \genetic drift" effect and to maximize the exploration of the
 model space. In fact, a wide and efficient exploration of the model space is i
mportant not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algori
thm optimization but also to ensure a reliable estimation of the posterior prob
ability distributions in the subsequent Gibbs sampler step.},[]

 information and therefore one can use any type of misfit function equally well
. Most iterative methods work with a single model and find improvements by pert
urbing it in some fashion. Genetic algorithms, however, work with a group of mo
dels simultaneously and use stochastic processes to guide the search for an opt
imal solution. Both Simulated Annealing and genetic algorithms are modelled on 
natural optimization systems. Simulated Annealing uses an analogy with thermody
namics; genetic algorithms have an analogy with biological evolution. This evol
ution leads to an efficient exchange of information between all models encounte
red, and allows the algorithm to rapidly assimilate and exploit the information
 gained to find better data fitting models. To illustrate the power of genetic 
algorithms compared to Monte Carlo, we consider a simple multidimensional quadr
atic optimization problem and show that its relative efficiency increases drama
tically as the number of unknowns is increased. As an example of their use in a
 geophysical problem with real data we consider the non-linear inversion of mar
ine seismic refraction waveforms. The results show that genetic algorithms are 
inherently superior to random search techniques and can also perform better tha
n iterative matrix inversion which requires a good starting model. This is prim
arily because genetic algorithms are able to combine both local and global sear
ch mechanisms into a single efficient method. Since many forward and inverse pr
oblems involve solving an optimization problem, we expect that the genetic appr
oach will find applications in many other geophysical problems; these include s
eismic ray tracing, earthquake location, non-linear data fitting and, possibly 
seismic tomography. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All right

geophysical research. Geophysical inversion can be formulated as an optimizatio
n problem to find the best parameters whose forward synthesis data most fit the
 observed data. The inverse problems are usually highly non-linear, multi-modal
 as well as ill-posed, so conventional optimization algorithms cannot handle it
 very efficiently. In the past decades, genetic algorithm (GA) and its many var
iants are widely applied to inverse problems and achieve great success. Swarm i
ntelligence algorithms are a family of global optimizers inspired by swarm phen
omena in nature, and have shown better performance than GA for diverse optimiza
tion problems. However, swarm intelligence algorithms are not utilized for geop
hysical inversion problems until recently and only limited number of works are 
reported. In this paper, we try to apply two swarm intelligence algorithms, Par
ticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), to the regional s
eismic waveform inversion. To explore the advantages and disadvantages of swarm
 intelligence algorithms over GA, synthetic experiments are conducted by using 
these two swarm intelligence algorithm and several GA variants as well as Diffe
rential Evolution (DE). The experimental results show that, both swarm intellig
ence algorithms outperform the widely used GA, DE, and the models estimated by 
swarm intelligence algorithms are closer to the true solution. The promising re
sults imply that swarm intelligence algorithms are a potentially more powerful 
tool for inversion problems.},[]

ptimisation methods using four analytic objective functions and two highly non-
linear geophysical optimisation problems: one-dimensional elastic full-waveform
 inversion and residual static computation. The four methods we consider, namel
y, adaptive simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, neighbourhood algorithm, an
d particle swarm optimisation, are frequently employed for solving geophysical 
inverse problems. Because geophysical optimisations typically involve many unkn
own model parameters, we are particularly interested in comparing the performan
ces of these stochastic methods as the number of unknown parameters increases. 
The four analytic functions we choose simulate common types of objective functi
ons encountered in solving geophysical optimisations: a convex function, two mu
lti-minima functions that differ in the distribution of minima, and a nearly fl
at function. Similar to the analytic tests, the two seismic optimisation proble
ms we analyse are characterised by very different objective functions. The firs
t problem is a one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversion, which is strong
ly ill-conditioned and exhibits a nearly flat objective function, with a valley
 of minima extended along the density direction. The second problem is the resi
dual static computation, which is characterised by a multi-minima objective fun
ction produced by the so-called cycle-skipping phenomenon. According to the tes
ts on the analytic functions and on the seismic data, genetic algorithm general
ly displays the best scaling with the number of parameters. It encounters probl
ems only in the case of irregular distribution of minima, that is, when the glo
bal minimum is at the border of the search space and a number of important loca
l minima are distant from the global minimum. The adaptive simulated annealing 
method is often the best-performing method for low-dimensional model spaces, bu
t its performance worsens as the number of unknowns increases. The particle swa
rm optimisation is effective in finding the global minimum in the case of low-d
imensional model spaces with few local minima or in the case of a narrow flat v
alley. Finally, the neighbourhood algorithm methodis competitive with the other
 methods only for low-dimensional model spaces; its performance sensibly worsen
s in the case of multi-minima objective functions.},[]

 algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function within a give
n parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients of the mi
sfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of models and a
ssociated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior probability di
stribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain Monte Ca
rlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and their as
sociated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior probability d
istribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropo
lis{Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability distribu
tions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a hybrid me
thod that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution
 and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation of the pos
terior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an analytical f
unction and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the true prob
ability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true uncertainties
. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibbs sampler
 step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributions. Then,
 we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing one-dimen

scuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential to atten
uate the \genetic drift" effect and to maximize the exploration of the model sp

not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algorithm optim

uares (L2) norm, the direct amplitude matching is never perfect and the accurat
e estimation of the seismic source strength is not always available. In contras
t, the normalized zero-lag cross-correlation objective function relaxes on the 
amplitude constraints and emphasizes the phase information when measuring the c
loseness between the simulated and observed data. This FWI method becomes insen
sitive to differences in amplitude. Based on this property, we investigate the 
effectiveness and robustness of FWI with the normalized zero-lag cross-correlat
ion function (CFWI) against the noise and unpredictable amplitude of the data t
hat cannot be modelled by the wavefield extrapolation operator. The effectivene
ss is firstly tested by noise-free data and data contaminated by Gaussian white
 noise. In addition, CFWI can invert the data set with incorrect source strengt
h when compared with the L2 norm. Moreover, the data set with incorrect source 
signature illustrates that CFWI is slightly more insensitive to the error in so
urce signature than the L2 norm. However, a source inversion is still needed wh
en the source signature is severely erroneous. With non-Gaussian noise data, su
ch as contaminated by strong ground motion noise and even by spike-type noise, 
CFWI provides a comparable result with that of the robust Huber norm. Numerical
 experiments with non-Gaussian noise also indicate that CFWI can suppress noise
 in data to produce clearer images when compared with the Huber norm. Besides, 
CFWI is free of the threshold criterion that controls the transition between th
e L2 and L1 norms used with the Huber and Hybrid norms and therefore free from 
tedious trial-and-error tests. Several numerical examples support that CFWI is 
an alternative and reliable inversion method. However, a numerical test with a 
1-D initial model confirms that CFWI is more sensitive to the cycle-skipping pr
oblem caused by less-accurate initial velocity model than the L2 norm, which is
 due to the wrong matched events contributing to spurious local minima of the o
bjective function of CFWI, but to an increase in the objective function used wi

thin the full-waveform-inversion strategy. This high-resolution seismic imaging
 method, based on a data-fitting procedure, suffers from the nonconvexity of th
e standard least-squares discrepancy measure, an issue commonly referred to as 
cycle skipping. The convexity of the optimal transport distance with respect to
 time shifts makes it a good candidate to provide a more convex misfit function
. However, the optimal transport distance is defined only for the comparison of
 positive functions, while seismic data are oscillatory. A review of the differ
ent attempts proposed in the literature to overcome this difficulty is proposed
. Their limitations are illustrated: Basically, the proposed strategies are eit
her not applicable to real data, or they lose the convexity property of optimal
 transport. On this basis, we introduce a novel strategy based on the interpret
ation of the seismic data in the graph space. Each individual trace is consider
ed, after discretization, as a set of Dirac points in a 2D space, where the amp
litude becomes a geometric attribute of the data. This ensures the positivity o
f the data, while preserving the geometry of the signal. The differentiability 
of the misfit function is obtained by approximating the Dirac distributions thr
ough 2D Gaussian functions. The interest of this approach is illustrated numeri
cally by computing misfit-function maps in schematic examples before moving to 
more realistic synthetic full-waveform exercises, including the Marmousi model.
 The better convexity of the graph-based optimal transport distance is shown. O
n the Marmousi model, starting from a 1D linearly increasing initial model, wit
