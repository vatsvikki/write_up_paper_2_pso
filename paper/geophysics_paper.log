 objective function prepared for the minimization is a multimodal function havi

or FWI to stuck in local minima if the starting model is not lie within the bas
in of attraction. FWI is based on caluclas based optimization mehtods which hav
e the tendency to move towards the nearest extrema this make it imposible to co
nverge to global minima if starting model is in local basin of attraction. This
 make it neccesary to start the inversion with a inital model located near to t
he global minima.[]

corealtion obective function matching only the phases to mitigate the effect of
 amplitudes, and most recent optimal transport function to deal by increasing t

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 This problem of stucking with the local minima is associated
 with the starting model. This problem can be dealt with preapring the initial 
model with the global optimization method becuase it have the ability to explor
e all the search space to find a optimal solution without the intervention of h
uman being as required in ray based tomography metyhods for preapring the intia
l model by this it also reduce the chance of inclusion of human errors. this su
permacy of global optimization motivated its utilization in prepasring the star
ting model for calculas based seismic inversion methods. The global optimizatio
n are inspired with the natural phenomina. the idea of preparing the initial mo
del with the global optimization is because of the slow exploitation of these m
ethods. once the initial model is prepared with the confidence that it lie in t
he basin of global minima then local optimization statred with this model becau
se local minima methods have high exploitation rate.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic method dev
eloped by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart in 1995. Inspired by the social be
havior of birds flocking to find food, they formulated a mathematical model to 
simulate this behavior. This model is widely applied to solve various optimizat
ion problems. They identified that the fundamental principle guiding birds' foo
d-finding behavior is their ability to communicate with each other. Each bird i
n the process knows its current position \((\mathbf{x}_i(t))\) and best positio
n \((\mathbf{p}_i(t))\), determined by evaluating the fitness using a cost func
tion. Additionally, each bird shares its best position with others, contributin
g to the collective knowledge of the flock's best position \((\mathbf{g}(t))\).
 Each bird's next movement is adjusted by its own best, the flock's best, and i
ts current position. This iterative process continues at each step, ultimately 
converging towards a globally optimal position through the collaborative effort
 of all birds.This natural phenomenon is mathematically described by the veloci
ty update equation \ref{eqn:pso_1} and the position update equation \ref{eqn:ps
o_2}.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 The updates in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorit
hm are influenced by several controlling parameters, including the inertia weig
ht \((w)\), acceleration coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2)\), population size of
 the swarm, and the number of iterations. Among these, the inertia weight is th
e most critical tuning parameter as it balances the exploration and exploitatio
n capabilities of PSO by adjusting the contribution of the particle's previous 
velocity. An inertia weight value between 0.4 and 0.9 is generally found to pro
vide good convergence. The cognitive and social coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2
)\) represent the confidence in a particle's own best position and the swarm's 
best position, respectively, and they influence the updated velocity of the par
ticles. The number of particles in the swarm also affects convergence; as the n
umber of particles increases, the search space expands, potentially leading to 
better convergence. Experimental studies have shown that a swarm size of around
 30 particles is generally effective for finding solutions within optimal itera
tions. The number of iterations, as with all iterative optimization algorithms,
 significantly impacts the performance of PSO.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) tries to estimate 
velocity models of the subsurface with improved accuracy and resolution compare
d to conventional methods. To be successful, it needs input data that is rich i
n low frequencies and possibly characterized by long source-to-receiver offsets
. The correct solution of the inverse problem by means of local methods is faci
litated if the starting model lies in the "valley" of the cost-function global 
minimum. We explore the possibility of relaxing this requirement by using genet
ic algorithms, a stochastic optimization method, as the driver of the FWI (GA F
WI). However, stochastic methods are affected by the "curse of dimensionality,"
 meaning that they require huge and sometimes even unaffordable computer resour
ces for inverse problems with many unknowns and costly forward modeling. Theref
ore, we need to adopt proper stratagems in the inversion and limit our goal to 
the estimation of a velocity macromodel that is of a model with only the long-w
avelength velocity structures, which could eventually act as the starting model
 for a local, higher-resolution gradient-based inversion. To this end, in the G
A FWI we parametrize the subsurface with two grids: (1) a coarse grid with wide
ly spaced nodes, that is unknowns, for the inversion, and (2) a fine grid with 
shorter spacing for the modeling. As a side result, we can also have an estimat
e of the uncertainty at the solution nodes of the grid. The approach we discuss
 is 2D acoustic in the time domain, with finite difference forward modeling. Th
e examples we show refer to the Marmousi model and to a marine field data set.}

shear (S)-wave velocity relies on the generation of dispersion curves of Raylei
gh waves. This constrains the method to only laterally homogeneous (or very smo
oth laterally heterogeneous) earth models. Waveform inversion directly fits wav
eforms on seismograms, hence, does not have such a limitation. Waveforms of Ray
leigh waves are highly related to S-wave velocities. By inverting the waveforms
 of Rayleigh waves on a near-surface seismogram, shallow S-wave velocities can 
be estimated for earth models with strong lateral heterogeneity. We employ gene
tic algorithm (GA) to perform waveform inversion of Rayleigh waves for S-wave v
elocities. The forward problem is solved by finite-difference modeling in the t
ime domain. The model space is updated by generating offspring models using GA.
 Final solutions can be found through an iterative waveform-fitting scheme. Inv
ersions based on synthetic records show that the S-wave velocities can be recov
ered successfully with errors no more than 10% for several typical near-surface
 earth models. For layered earth models, the proposed method can generate one-d
imensional S-wave velocity profiles without the knowledge of initial models. Fo
r earth models containing lateral heterogeneity in which case conventional disp
ersion-curve-based inversion methods are challenging, it is feasible to produce
 high-resolution S-wave velocity sections by GA waveform inversion with appropr
iate priori information. The synthetic tests indicate that the GA waveform inve
rsion of Rayleigh waves has the great potential for shallow S-wave velocity ima

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 abstract = {ABSTRACT Stochastic optimization methods, such a
s genetic algorithms, search for the global minimum of the misfit function with
in a given parameter range and do not require any calculation of the gradients 
of the misfit surfaces. More importantly, these methods collect a series of mod
els and associated likelihoods that can be used to estimate the posterior proba
bility distribution. However, because genetic algorithms are not a Markov chain
 Monte Carlo method, the direct use of the genetic-algorithm-sampled models and
 their associated likelihoods produce a biased estimation of the posterior prob
ability distribution. In contrast, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as th
e Metropolis{Hastings and Gibbs sampler, provide accurate posterior probability
 distributions but at considerable computational cost. In this paper, we use a 
hybrid method that combines the speed of a genetic algorithm to find an optimal
 solution and the accuracy of a Gibbs sampler to obtain a reliable estimation o
f the posterior probability distributions. First, we test this method on an ana
lytical function and show that the genetic algorithm method cannot recover the 
true probability distributions and that it tends to underestimate the true unce
rtainties. Conversely, combining the genetic algorithm optimization with a Gibb
s sampler step enables us to recover the true posterior probability distributio
ns. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid method by performing 
one-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversions on synthetic and field data. W
e also discuss how an appropriate genetic algorithm implementation is essential
 to attenuate the \genetic drift" effect and to maximize the exploration of the
 model space. In fact, a wide and efficient exploration of the model space is i
mportant not only to avoid entrapment in local minima during the genetic algori
thm optimization but also to ensure a reliable estimation of the posterior prob
ability distributions in the subsequent Gibbs sampler step.},[]
