[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic method dev
eloped by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart in 1995. Inspired by the social be
havior of birds flocking to find food, they formulated a mathematical model to 
simulate this behavior. This model is widely applied to solve various optimizat
ion problems. They identified that the fundamental principle guiding birds' foo
d-finding behavior is their ability to communicate with each other. Each bird i
n the process knows its current position \((x_i(t))\) and best position \((p_i(
t))\), determined by evaluating the fitness using a cost function. Additionally
, each bird shares its best position with others, contributing to the collectiv
e knowledge of the flock's best position \((g(t))\). Each bird's next movement 
is adjusted by its own best, the flock's best, and its current position. This i
terative process continues at each step, ultimately converging towards a global
ly optimal position through the collaborative effort of all birds.This natural 
phenomenon is mathematically described by the velocity update equation \ref{eqn
:pso_1} and the position update equation \ref{eqn:pso_2}.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 The updates in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorit
hm are influenced by several controlling parameters, including the inertia weig
ht \((w)\), acceleration coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2)\), population size of
 the swarm, and the number of iterations. Among these, the inertia weight is th
e most critical tuning parameter as it balances the exploration and exploitatio
n capabilities of PSO by adjusting the contribution of the particle's previous 
velocity. An inertia weight value between 0.4 and 0.9 is generally found to pro
vide good convergence. The cognitive and social coefficients \((c_1\) and \(c_2
)\) represent the confidence in a particle's own best position and the swarm's 
best position, respectively, and they influence the updated velocity of the par
ticles. The number of particles in the swarm also affects convergence; as the n
umber of particles increases, the search space expands, potentially leading to 
better convergence. Experimental studies have shown that a swarm size of around
 30 particles is generally effective for finding solutions within optimal itera
tions. The number of iterations, as with all iterative optimization algorithms,
 significantly impacts the performance of PSO.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (7476.55891pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 265--265
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 This contribution of different parameters for succes of PSO 
make it is necessary to decide the combination of these parameters precisely. w
e have performed experiments to find the optimal combination of this values, fo
r these experiment we have choose four nonlinear functions Ackley, Griewank, Ra
strigin, and Styblinski-Tang function shown in figure \ref{fig:ackley}, \ref{fi
g:griewank}, \ref{fig:rastrigin}, and \ref{fig:styblinski} respectively. These 
experiments are performed to determine the optimal value of the optimization co
efficient and examine the relationship between the number of iterations and swa
rm size. Since both swarm size and iteration count impact computational time, i
t is essential to balance these factors to achieve effective optimization while
 minimizing computational costs. To fairly compare the effects of swarm size an
d the number of iterations, the rate of increase for both parameters is kept co
nsistent. Following this, PSO is applied to the Schwefel function using the par
ameters chosen from the previous experiment to achieve the parameters that lead
 to the best convergence. To analyze performance, accuracy is evaluated based o
n the maximum deviation using equation \ref{eqn:accuracy}. Further details of t
hese experiments are outlined below.[]

hile maintaining a constant swarm size of 30 and an initial iteration count of 
1000, which is then increased by factors of 1.67, 2.0, 2.67, 3.00, 5, and 10, t
o examine how the number of iterations impacts accuracy across all test functio
ns. The results indicate that as the number of iterations increases, accuracy i
mproves, reaching a maximum close to 100 \% when iterations are increased to 10
 times, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:acc_itr}.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 \item Acuuracy with swarm size: In this study, accuracy is e
valuated across all tests by varying the swarm size, starting with 30 particles
 and increasing it by factors of 1.67, 2.0, 2.67, 3.00, 5, and 10, while keepin
g the number of iterations constant at 1000. The findings indicate that as the 
swarm size increases, accuracy improves to approximately 70 \%.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 From these experiments for finding the optimization paramete
rs, it is concluded that an optimal combination of inertia weights between 0.5 
and 0.8, \(c_1\) values ranging from 0.6 to 2.0, and \(c_2\) values between 0.6
 and 1.8 leads to enhanced accuracy. Additionally, increasing the number of ite
rations relative to the number of particles is beneficial, as it provide improv
ed accuracy while maintaining similar computational costs.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 The parameters that performed well in the previous experimen
ts with test functions are used to evaluate the rate of convergence for the Sch
wefel function, as shown in figure \ref{fig:schwefel}. This additional test fun
ction focuses solely on the objective function with respect to the number of it
erations, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:con_schwefel}. The aim of this stud
y is to identify a combination of optimization parameters that achieve a better
 rate of convergence, enabling optimized results to be obtained within fewer it
erations. Figure \ref{fig:con_schwefel} illustrates that higher values of inert
ia do not show convergence, while lower values of inertia exhibit a high rate o
f convergence but fail to reach the optimized value. An inertia value of 0.6 de
monstrates good convergence with different \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) values. This ana
lysis reveals that \(c_1\) at 1.8 and \(c_2\) at both 1.8 and 2.4 converge to z
ero, albeit slowly. In contrast, \(c_1\) at 2.4 and \(c_2\) ranging from 1.2 to
 1.8 exhibit a good rate of convergence, reaching near zero within 100 iteratio
ns. Based on this analysis, the optimal parameters for further seismic inversio
n are set as inertia at 0.6, \(c_1\) at 2.4, and \(c_2\) between 1.2 and 1.8.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 The seismic model includes physical parameters defined at de
nsely packed grid points, often in the thousands, leading to an exponentially e
xpanding search space that complicates the implementation of PSO. Thus, it is c
rucial to develop a method for sparsely defining these model parameters before 
implementing PSO, ensuring that the output model can effectively serve as an in
itial model for FWI.[]
